Vessel Dataset and Models
=======
Vessel Dataset
------
This is the tagged vessel dataset that we have created,The vessel dataset contains 40000 tagged vessel images. 
The database contains images including variations of illumination, noise,  angle of video cameras, weather. 
All of these image data are based on the actual monitoring of the Yangtze River channel video acquisition.
Our database has a total of 16 types of ships,ie:bulk freighter,ro-ro ship,Container Ship,barge,speed boat,sampan,Fishing boat,Medium passenger ships,Tour boat,Working Ship,Tank Ship,Cargo Ship,Dump Ship,Gondola,Awning ship,Log Carrier.
Due to copyright factors, we have only published a portion of the data set.you can get our [tagged vessel datset](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Akh-8dX-yfy-gxJz-UGNAaOfk6MS)

Caffe Models
-----
Using a collection of videos and images with vessel type labels, we train three neural network models to recognition vessel types and we obtained the TOP-1 97.119% accuracy by using our neural network models in vessel validation dataset.Our models [Caffe Implementation-OneDrive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bptZbA3)
